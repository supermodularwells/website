## Working Papers

1. **Craig AC & Slemrod, JB.** "Tax Knowledge and Tax Manipulation: A Unifying Model". [[Working Paper](http://sites.lsa.umich.edu/ashcraig/wp-content/uploads/sites/716/2022/01/knowledge.pdf)] <details>Taxpayers face complex tax systems, which many struggle to understand while others strive to exploit. We characterize optimal tax rates and taxpayer education when heterogeneous individuals have an incomplete understanding of the tax system. The analysis shows how learning about tax minimization strategies is isomorphic to learning about tax rates. In both cases, the government faces a trade-off: Educating taxpayers allows them to better optimize, but affects government revenue. The optimal amount of taxpayer education and redistribution are both characterized by aggregate sufficient statistics, which do not require information about how biases or behavioral responses vary across decision margins.</details>
