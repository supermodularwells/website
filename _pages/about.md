I am a Senior Lecturer in Economics at the Australian National University (ANU), and a John Mitchell Fellow. My research spans Public Economics and Labor Economics, with a particular focus on human capital investment, taxation, and inequality. I am also affiliated with the [Office of Tax Policy Research](https://rossweb.bus.umich.edu/otpr/) at the University of Michigan, the [Institute of Labor Economics](https://www.iza.org/person/21108/ashley-c-craig) and the ANU [Tax & Transfer Policy Institute](https://taxpolicy.crawford.anu.edu.au/taxpolicy-people/research-affiliates).

## Background

Prior to joining ANU, I was an Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan [Department of Economics](https://lsa.umich.edu/econ). I received my PhD from Harvard University in May 2019, and my undergraduate degree is from the University of Sydney. Previously, I worked as an economist at the Reserve Bank of Australia. While at Harvard, I was a James M. and Cathleen D. Stone Ph.D. Scholar in Inequality and Wealth Concentration, and recipient of a Lara Warner Ph.D. fellowship from the Harvard Kennedy School Women and Public Policy Program. I received teaching awards from both Harvard University and the University of Sydney. In 2020, I received the IIPF Young Economists Award from the International Institute of Public Finance.
