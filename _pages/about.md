I am a public and labor economist at the University of Michigan [Department of Economics]{https://lsa.umich.edu/econ}. My current research focuses on human capital investment, taxation, and inequality â€“ especially in environments in which beliefs are formed based on imperfect information. I am also affiliated with the Office of Tax Policy Research, the Institute of Labor Economics and the Tax & Transfer Policy Institute at the Australian National University.

I received my PhD from Harvard University in May 2019, and my undergraduate degree is from the University of Sydney. Previously, I worked as an economist at the Reserve Bank of Australia. While at Harvard, I was a James M. and Cathleen D. Stone Ph.D. Scholar in Inequality and Wealth Concentration, and recipient of a Lara Warner Ph.D. fellowship from the Harvard Kennedy School Women and Public Policy Program. I received teaching awards from both Harvard University and the University of Sydney. In 2020, I received the IIPF Young Economists Award from the International Institute of Public Finance.
