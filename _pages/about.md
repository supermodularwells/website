From June 2023, I will be a Senior Lecturer in Economics at the [Research School of Economics](https://rse.anu.edu.au/) at Australian National University (ANU), and a John Mitchell Fellow.  I am also affiliated with the [Office of Tax Policy Research](https://rossweb.bus.umich.edu/otpr/) at the University of Michigan, the [Institute of Labor Economics](https://www.iza.org/person/21108/ashley-c-craig) and the ANU [Tax & Transfer Policy Institute](https://taxpolicy.crawford.anu.edu.au/taxpolicy-people/research-affiliates).

My research spans Public Economics and Labor Economics, with a particular focus on human capital investment, taxation, and inequality.

## Background

Prior to joining ANU, I was an Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan [Department of Economics](https://lsa.umich.edu/econ). I received my PhD in Economics from [Harvard University](https://economics.harvard.edu/) in May 2019, and my undergraduate degree is from the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/). Previously, I worked as an economist at the [Reserve Bank of Australia](https://www.rba.gov.au/).

While at Harvard, I was a [James M. and Cathleen D. Stone Ph.D. Scholar in Inequality and Wealth Concentration](https://inequality.hks.harvard.edu/fellowship-awards), and recipient of a Lara Warner Ph.D. fellowship from the [Harvard Kennedy School Women and Public Policy Program](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/wappp). I received teaching awards from both Harvard University and the University of Sydney. In 2020, I received the [IIPF Young Economists Award](https://www.iipf.org/yeaw.htm) from the [International Institute of Public Finance](https://www.iipf.org/index.htm).
